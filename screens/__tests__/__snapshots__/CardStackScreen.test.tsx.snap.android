The resistance will slowly increase as you make contact with the patient's energy. The patient's body is seldom actually touched. Instead, the work takes place around the patient in the living energy field. These movements help to reprogram the metabolism and return a healthy calmness to the body.
            
The healer begins the session by positioning a hand on either side of the patient at the hip area. The fingertips are positioned slightly apart, with the fingers and palms gently curved upwards, as if the healer was holding a large grapefruit in each hand. The healer now slowly inhales through the nostrils and continues to inhale while moving the hands upwards until they are facing just above the patient's head (crown chakra). The hands nearly come together above the head but do not touch each other. The hands never touch each other. The hands are now in a position above the patient's head, as if the healer were holding a crown between them.
            
The movement is now reversed. The healer slowly begins to exhale, and continues to exhale, while simultaneously rotating the curved fingertips and palms downward. The hands now gently glide down to the original starting point at the patient's hips, where the hand motions are again reversed and the entire sequence repeated without stopping for 5 or 6 minutes.

The body will accept that signal as its own and healing will begin. Begin with both hands facing each other in front of the patient's forehead between the eyebrows. Keep the left hand still so that body signals can be intuitively sensed. Damaged energy that the patient's body is not able to release will leave the patient's body and seek ground by entering the healer's left hand. Healthy energy is already grounded by the patient's own body and will not be affected.
            
The healer now gently inhales through the nostrils and simultaneously moves the right hand away from the left hand about six inches. The healer then exhales through the nostrils and simultaneously moves the right hand back to the beginning position. Both hands then are then lowered about an inch and the sequence is repeated over and over again until both hands are at the level of the bladder.
            
These movements through the patient's living energy field help to reprogram the metabolism by improving the patient's microcirculation and establishing balance in the energy flow. A healthy calmness returns to the body when irregular signals have been removed from the living energy field.

When the throat area is reached, the healer exhales through the nostrils and lowers both curled hands back to the level of the umbilicus. When the original position is attained, the hands then uncurl and the sequence is repeated for 5 to 6 minutes.
            
This sequence addresses patients that experience severe exhaustion, anxiety, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, fatigue and overall malaise. This sequence should be avoided for patients with hypertension.

The healer then begins to exhale and both hands are moved back to the center of the patient's body until one hand is positioned above the other without touching. From this position the hands are then moved apart as the healer inhales and the entire sequence is repeated for 3 to 5 minutes.

The thumb of each hand then sequentially touches (rubs) each fingertip of the hand, starting with the little finger and move up the hand to the index finger. The motion resembles picking up a pinch of salt smoothly between thumb and each finger of the hand. This move is designed to remove excess and irregular energy signals that have been absorbed from the patient.
            
Whenever the healer's hands feel heaviness, throbbing, or tingling the pinch of salt movement should be performed. You may perform this for 1 to 3 minutes according to the intensity of the signals in your hands.

The healer then exhales and both hands are moved back to the starting position without touching. This sequence is repeated for 5 to 10 minutes.
            
As the sequence is performed, the healer will sense a magneic field building between the hands. The sensation is faint in the begining, but will grow stronger as the work continues. These movemens should be done slowly and purposefully, as if the space betweenthe hands is somehow being compressed. The patient will feel a warmto almost hot sensation in the area receiving healing. Many actually feel the pressing movement itself, even though the healer's hands have never touched them. Some experience muscle contractions. This movement helps to charge the body's circulation and increase organ productivity. It can be performed on three different organs at once (liver, gallbladder and spleen), or it can be done individually for each organ. It is quite beneficial for the adrenal glands and kidneys.

With the right hand only, position the fingers as if the hand is gently holding a small ball. The fingertips do not touch each other. Starting at the back of the patient's head, begin to make continuous, circular movements in a clockwise position, as if the hand was writing the number zero over and over again. Move the hand very slowly down the spine, collecting irregular signals in the palm until the tailbone area is reached. Perform the salt pinching motion until the hand feels free of any sensations that may have accumulated. The hand is then moved freely to the starting position and the entire sequence repeated for 1 to 5 minutes.

The healer begins the sequence by positioning both handsparallel to each other about 2 to 3 inches apart with the curved fingertips slightly spread and both thumbs facing the fingertips. The hands are positioned about 2 to 3 inches away from the area of the patient's body the healer wishes to charge. The hands do not move and the healer's breathing is unrestricted. It is very important to keep the hands in a stable yet relaxed position. Direct your fingertips slightly toward the organ being charged and wait. A warm or cold feeling may develop between both hands. The palms may perspire. Pay attention to any irregular signals as they enter the hands. At regular intervals, remove these by performing the Pinch of Salt movement.

The healer begins this sequence by positioning both hands parallel to each other, fingertips slightly apart with both thumbs pointed towards the fingertips. The healer's breathing is easily and without constraint. Hold this position on either side of the patient's body. Wait to sense a fine thread of energy that connects the palms of both hands. Do not rush this.
            
Once the connection is made begin to slowly move both hands back and forth with a flossing motion. Both hands move in the same direction and the same distance. When the left hand moves to the left, the right hand will also move to the left with the same distance. Repeat these movements for 5 to 7 minutes.

The healer stands in front of the patient and extends both arms outward, as if preparing to embrace the patient. Hands are widely parallel to each other, and the fingertips are slightly apart with thumbs facing the fingertips. The healer's breathing is free and at will. The healer then begins to compact the living energy field by moving both hands simultaneously towards the patient's body and \\"patting\\" or compacting the energy closer to the patient's body. The motion resembles adding handfuls of snow to a snowman's body, but the hands never touch each other or the patient's body.
            
This back and forth compacting motion is done slowly from the patient's head area all the way to the feet. The healer then moves 45 degrees to the patient's side and repeats the sequence from the feet area back to the head. When this is finished the healer will then move another 45 degrees to the patient's back and repeats the sequence from the head down to the feet. All four sides of the patient's body must be compacted until the healer is back at the original position. This can be repeated several times.

This is perhaps the most intimate form of energy healing and involves the direct touching of the patient's body. The healer places both hands on either side of the body part to receive healing and waits. During this time the healer may reassure the patient and speaks in a quiet and pleasant manner.
            
Contact healing is particularly useful for patients suffering from stroke, Parkinson Disease, epilepsy, migraines, depression and other neurological disturbances. It helps to calm the mind and regulate the proper flow of life energies. This will result in a sense of peace and overall well being.
            
There are few rules related to contact healing. The most important being time. The contact must be established and maintained for at least 15 to 25 minutes depending on the patient's condition. Should the healer feel irregular signals in the hands that may be perceived as throbbing, sweatiness, tingling, heat/cold, or heaviness the pinch of salt maneuver should be performed. Immediately following the pinch of salt maneuver return to contact healing.
            
This technique also works well for the kidneys. Place both hands on each side of patient's kidneys for 15 to 25 minutes. This grounds and improves the blood flow for the kidneys and adrenal glands, and will help to balance both high and low blood pressure. For ailments of the stomach including digestive disorders, ulcers, and hernias, apply one hand to the patient's stomach from the front and other from the back. Maintain contact healing for 15 to 17 minutes.

          "description": "Correctly ending the healing session is as important as correctly beginning the session, as it is the final process of permanently removing toxic energies from the body. End each energy healing session by grounding these energies. This is accomplished by a double hand technique that resembles a type of direct contact massage. Both hands will move in a circular, clockwise direction with the patient's body between them. At first this might appear to be easy, however to the beginning energy healer the pattern of movement may feel as confusing as the proverbial \\"pat your head and rub your belly\\" game played by children.
            
To correctly do this sequence, conceptualize the patient's body in two parts. Both the front of the body and the back of the body are facing the healer at the same time. Place the right hand on the patient's chest and the left hand on the patient's back. Now move both hands in a circular, clockwise manner, as if writing the number zero over and over again. Once this is accomplished, conceptualize turning the front side of the body 90 degrees away from the healer. The patient's right shoulder should be facing the healer. Now move both hands in the same circular, clockwise manner. Once this is accomplished, conceptualize turning the backside of the body 90 degrees away from the healer. The patient's left shoulder should be facing the healer. Continue to move both hands in the same circular, clockwise motion as before. Repeat this motion 7 times.
            
Key note: No matter how the patient's body is positioned, or where the healer is positioned, the hand moving across the patient's body moves in a clockwise manner. If another person was watching the movement directly in front of or directly in back of the patient's body, the hand moving across the patient's body moves in a clockwise manner.

            
The next sequence involves using one hand only. With the right hand positioned at the nap of the patient's neck, make a horizontal, sweeping motion down the spine to the tailbone. Then, from the tailbone move the hand with a sweeping motion back up to the nap of the neck. Do this down/up sweeping motion 7 times.
            
Now ask the patient to stand. With both hands gently grab the patient's ankles at the Achilles tendon and with your index finger and thumb give the tendon a tiny pinch for five seconds and then let go. This completes the final energy grounding for the session.
